# What's New?

A React based application that displays News Articles depending on the genre selected, or the input search value.   

This application was built with `create-react-app`.

### Set Up

Clone down this repo.  

run `npm install`.  

run `npm start`.  

Web application should now be available at `localhost:3000`.  
 
### Objectives

Implement our React components in a web application. Learn how components interact with each other, and are all contained within the App.js component. Install `enzyme` and `jest` dependencies and test all React class-based and function-based components. Apply snapshot testing and mock instance testing. 

### Challenges & Further Iterations

I would want to pull the data down from the local url with a fetch request, and then be able to sort out the data and display in the same way as now.   

Further iterations would include a responsive design, down to a mobile site, as well accessibility needs for all users.
